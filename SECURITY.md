## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ryanmat/mcp-server-logicmonitor/security/advisories/new),
   which is enabled on this repository and keeps the report private until a fix
   ships. The "Report a vulnerability" button on the Security tab does the same.
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce

You can expect:
- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the fix progress
- Credit in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Considerations

### Credential Handling
- Bearer tokens are passed via environment variables only
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use `.env` files locally (included in `.gitignore`)

### Inbound HTTP Exposure
- The HTTP transport drives the full tool surface with the server's LogicMonitor
  credentials. Anyone who can reach the port can use them.
- Set `LM_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` whenever the port is reachable beyond localhost:
  `/mcp` and `/api/v1/*` then require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and
  return 401 otherwise. Starting without it logs a warning.
- `/`, `/health`, `/healthz`, and `/readyz` stay unauthenticated so container
  healthchecks and orchestrator probes keep working. Their responses carry
  component status, never LogicMonitor data. One caveat: with
  `LM_HEALTH_CHECK_CONNECTIVITY=true` (off by default), each `/readyz` request
  calls the LogicMonitor API with your credentials, so an unauthenticated
  caller can consume your portal's API quota. Leave that flag off, or put the
  probe endpoints behind your ingress, on deployments reachable from untrusted
  networks.
- Pair the token with TLS (the Caddy profile in `deploy/`, or `LM_HTTP_SSL_*`)
  so it is not sent in cleartext.
- The stdio transport is unaffected: it has no listening socket.

### Write Operations
- Write operations are disabled by default
- Enable only when needed: `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true`
- Review permissions granted to your LogicMonitor API token

### Container Security
- Docker image runs as non-root user
- Minimal base image (python:slim)
- No sensitive data persisted in container

### Best Practices
- Use dedicated API tokens with minimal required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor LogicMonitor audit logs for unexpected API activity
