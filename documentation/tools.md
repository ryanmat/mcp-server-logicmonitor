# LogicMonitor MCP Server: Tool Reference

<!-- GENERATED FILE. Do not edit by hand. Regenerate: uv run python tests/test_tools_doc.py -->

Reference for all 306 tools the LogicMonitor MCP server can advertise (core plus the optional Ansible Automation Platform, Terraform, and IBM watsonx.ai integrations). The **Write** column shows whether a tool requires `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true`.

This file is generated from the tool registry (`src/lm_mcp/registry.py`) and the domain index (`lm://guide/tool-categories`), and kept in sync by `tests/test_tools_doc.py`. At runtime, discover tools with the `search_tools` tool.

## Composite Workflows

Composite workflow tools -- recommended starting point

| Tool | Description | Write |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `triage` | Composite triage: correlates alerts, clusters by device/time, scores noise, assesses blast radius, and checks recent changes. Returns a prioritized incident report. | No |
| `health_check` | Composite health check: resolves a device, scores health across datasources, detects anomalies, checks alerts, and calculates availability. Returns a single device health report. | No |
| `capacity_plan` | Composite capacity planning: forecasts metric breach dates, classifies trends, detects seasonality and change points. Returns per-datasource capacity projections. | No |
| `portal_overview` | Composite portal overview: aggregates alert statistics, collector health, maintenance windows, noise scores, and dead devices into a shift-handoff report. | No |
| `diagnose` | Composite diagnosis: given an alert or device, gathers alert details, device context, correlated alerts, recent changes, blast radius, and health score. Returns a diagnosis report with probable root cause and recommendations. | No |
| `update_logicmodule` | Safe partial update for LogicMonitor source types (configsource, datasource, eventsource, logsource, propertysource, topologysource). Exports the current full definition, deep-merges your `changes` onto it, validates required fields, and either returns a dry-run diff (mode='preview', default) or applies the merged definition (mode='apply'). PREFER this over the raw update_<type> tools for partial updates -- the raw tools are full-replace and will blank any field omitted from the payload (two prior production incidents). | Yes |
| `detect_site_outage` | Composite workflow for site outage detection. Chains CollectorDown detection, mass-interface-down burst analysis, UPS on-battery events, and downstream device silence into a single site-outage verdict with confidence score, scope, and affected device list. Designed to catch the class of site-outage that generic AIOps correlation misses. Pass a device group ID representing the site. | No |
| `audit_network_monitoring_coverage` | Portal audit that counts UPS/PDU devices onboarded, interface DataSources applied, SNMP credentials configured, and NetFlow exporters set up. Returns a prioritized gap list with onboarding recommendations — turns 'you can't detect X' into 'here's how to enable detection of X.' | No |

## Universal Reference

Resource/Prompt mirrors exposed as Tools for clients without those primitives

| Tool | Description | Write |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `get_reference` | Get LogicMonitor reference content (schemas, enums, filter syntax, guides). Mirrors content from MCP Resources for clients without full Resource support (Copilot cloud agent, OpenAI Codex, Cline). Categories: schema, enums, filters, syntax, guide. Pass list=true (or omit both category and name) to discover all available (category, name) pairs. | No |
| `get_workflow` | Get LogicMonitor workflow guidance text (incident_triage, rca_workflow, remediate_workflow, etc.). Mirrors MCP Prompt content for clients without Prompt support. Prefer the composite workflow tools (triage, diagnose, health_check, capacity_plan, portal_overview) when they exist -- those execute the procedure. Pass list=true to discover available workflows. | No |

## Alerts

Alert monitoring and management

| Tool | Description | Write |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `get_alerts` | Get alerts from LogicMonitor with optional filtering For Kubernetes clusters, use group_id (from get_device_groups) instead of device — the device name filter does not work reliably for K8s resources. Common mistakes: startEpoch/endEpoch use SECONDS not milliseconds. String filter values need double quotes (e.g., monitorObjectName:"hostname"). | No |
| `get_alert_details` | Get detailed information about a specific alert | No |

## Usage examples for the ML and statistical tools

These tools use pure-Python statistical methods (no external ML libraries). They all operate on data fetched from the LM API at query time. Most metric-based tools share the same core parameters: `device_id`, `device_datasource_id`, `instance_id` (find these using `get_device_datasources` and `get_device_instances`).

**Capacity forecasting** -- predict when a metric will breach a threshold:
```
"Forecast when memory usage on device 150098 will exceed 90%"
```
Uses `forecast_metric` with `threshold=90`. Supports `method` parameter: `"auto"` (default, selects based on data), `"linear"` (regression), or `"holt_winters"` (seasonal). Returns days until breach, trend direction, confidence interval, and method used. Use `hours_back=168` (1 week) for meaningful regression, or `hours_back=24` if the device has limited history.

**Metric correlation** -- find relationships between metrics across devices:
```
"Correlate CPU usage on server A with memory usage on server B over the last 24 hours"
```
Uses `correlate_metrics` with a `sources` array. Each source requires `device_id`, `device_datasource_id`, `instance_id`, and `datapoint` name. Returns an NxN Pearson correlation matrix and highlights strong correlations (|r| > 0.7). Maximum 10 sources per call.

**Change point detection** -- find when metric behavior shifted:
```
"Detect any regime shifts in CPU metrics on device 150098 in the last 24 hours"
```
Uses `detect_change_points` with CUSUM algorithm. The `sensitivity` parameter (default 1.0) controls detection threshold -- lower values detect smaller shifts. Returns timestamps and direction of each detected change.

**Alert noise scoring** -- identify tuning opportunities:
```
"Score the alert noise across all devices over the last 24 hours"
```
Uses `score_alert_noise`. Returns a 0-100 noise score combining Shannon entropy, flap detection (alerts that clear and re-fire within 30 minutes), and repeat ratio. Includes top noisy devices/datasources and tuning recommendations.

**Device health scoring** -- aggregate health into a single number:
```
"Give me a health score for the stress-demo pod"
```
Uses `score_device_health`. Computes z-scores for each datapoint's latest value against its historical window, then produces a weighted composite score (0-100). Status: healthy (80+), degraded (50-79), critical (<50). Use the `weights` parameter to emphasize specific datapoints.

**Availability calculation** -- SLA reporting from alert data:
```
"Calculate 30-day availability across all devices at error severity or above"
```
Uses `calculate_availability` with `hours_back=720` and `severity_threshold="error"`. Merges overlapping alert windows and returns availability %, MTTR, incident count, longest incident, and per-device breakdown.
