## [3.9.0] - Unreleased

Correctness and reliability sweep. Started from dashboard/report bugs hit against a
live portal (root causes confirmed against the LM v3 API shapes -- widget placement
lives on the dashboard's `widgetsConfig` keyed by widget id; the report schedule is a
flat cron string, not a nested object) and extended to silent failures that corrupt
health verdicts.

### Added

- **Server instructions** that steer the model to call `search_tools` first and point at
  the composite workflow tools, so the large tool surface is navigated by search rather
  than enumeration (the established pattern for large MCP servers).
- **A tool-contract snapshot test** (`tests/test_tool_contract.py` against
  `tests/fixtures/tool_list.json`) that fails on any accidental change to a tool name,
  parameter, type, required field, description, or schema across all 280 tools.
  Intentional changes regenerate the fixture with
  `uv run python tests/test_tool_contract.py`.
- A `WORKFLOW_TOOLS` membership guard (every tool implemented in `tools/workflows.py`
  must be in the curated set), a `search_tools` coverage test (configured AWX/Terraform
  tools are searchable), and a duplicate-tool-name guard.

### Fixed

- **`create_dashboard(template=...)` silently dropped every widget.** The handler
  copied the exported definition into the create body and POSTed it once; the dashboard
  create endpoint does not accept embedded widgets, so cloning an exported dashboard
  produced an empty one (HTTP 200, `success: true`, zero widgets) while only
  `widgetTokens` survived. `create_dashboard` now creates the shell, recreates each
  widget from the template's `widgets_full` on the new dashboard (old id stripped, new
  `dashboardId` set), and re-applies the exported `widgetsConfig` placement remapped to
  the new widget ids. A single failed widget is logged with stack trace and surfaced as
  a `widget_warnings` entry rather than aborting the clone or vanishing. This makes
  `export_dashboard` -> `create_dashboard` round-trip widgets, not just the shell.
- **`add_widget` silently discarded widget placement.** `columnIdx`/`rowSpan`/`colSpan`
  were sent on the `/dashboard/widgets` body, which the API accepts and discards, so
  every widget landed at the default cell and the position parameters were dead.
  Placement lives on the parent dashboard's `widgetsConfig` (keyed by widget id);
  `add_widget` now writes it there via a PATCH that preserves sibling positions, and
  only when a position is requested (otherwise the portal auto-places). Added a `row`
  parameter for explicit vertical placement.
- **`get_dashboard_widgets` returned null `column`/`row_span`/`col_span` for every
  widget.** It read those off the widget objects, which never carry them; it now sources
  `column`/`row`/`col_span`/`row_span` from the parent dashboard's `widgetsConfig`.
- **`get_dashboards` reported `widget_count: 0` for widget-bearing dashboards.**
  `_count_widgets` only counted `widgetsConfig` as a list or a literal `count` key;
  real portals return a dict keyed by widget id. It now counts the keyed dict, and the
  same helper backs `delete_dashboard`'s count (previously `len(..., [])` on the wrong
  default type).
- **`update_widget` could 400 on echoed read-only fields and could not move a widget.**
  Content updates now strip server-managed read-only fields (`lastUpdatedOn`,
  `lastUpdatedBy`, `userPermission`) before the PUT; placement updates route to the
  dashboard `widgetsConfig` PATCH. `update_dashboard` likewise strips dashboard
  read-only fields (`fullName`, `userPermission`, `groupName`, `groupFullPath`,
  `owner`) before its PUT.
- **`run_report` posted to a nonexistent `/functions` endpoint** and 404'd on every v3
  portal. It now triggers generation via `POST /report/reports/{id}/executions` and
  returns the execution `taskId` and `resulturl` for polling.
- **The report `schedule` was modeled as a nested dict, but the LM v3 field is a flat
  string** (a cron expression; empty means unscheduled) with a separate
  `scheduleTimezone` string. The dict model broke every path: `update_report_schedule`
  raised `TypeError` (`'str' object does not support item assignment`) on a real
  scheduled report, `get_scheduled_reports` raised `AttributeError` calling `.get()` on
  a string, and `create_report` sent a wrong-typed body. `create_report`,
  `update_report_schedule`, `get_scheduled_reports`, and `get_report` now use the flat
  `schedule`/`scheduleTimezone` strings, and `update_report_schedule` strips report
  read-only fields before its PUT.
- **Three health-verdict signals were silently zeroed on API failure**, none logged:
  - `get_collector_health` returned `active_collector_down_alerts: 0` (and
    `is_down: false`) whenever the CollectorDown alert query failed, so a real outage
    could read `collectors_down: 0`. The probe now returns "unknown" instead of 0 on
    failure, sets a per-collector `down_signal_unavailable` flag plus a top-level
    `collectors_down_signal_unavailable` count and warning, and logs the exception.
  - `analyze_blast_radius` treated a failed neighbor lookup as "no neighbors" and a
    failed per-device alert lookup as `has_critical: false`, understating the blast
    radius and reporting alerting devices as healthy. Failures are now logged, the
    device is marked `alert_status_unavailable` with `has_critical: null`, and the
    response carries a `degraded` flag.
  - `get_remediation_history` turned a failed audit-log read (commonly a 403) into the
    benign "no remediation execution records found" note, conflating "could not read"
    with "nothing ran." It now logs the failure and returns a distinct
    `audit_read_failed` note stating history is unavailable, not confirmed empty.
- Added module loggers to `collectors`, `topology_analysis`, and `remediationsources`
  so these degrade-on-failure paths log a stack trace before falling back (per the
  no-silent-except rule).
- **MED/LOW silent-failure hardening** across degrade-on-failure paths, each now logged
  before the fallback:
  - `ingest_post` returned blanket success on an HTTP 202 even when the body reported
    per-record rejections (silent ingestion data loss). It now inspects the 202 body
    and raises on an error envelope or `success: false`.
  - `correlate_changes` turned a failed audit/change-log read into "0 changes"; it now
    sets `audit_read_failed` + a warning so "no changes" is not confused with "could
    not read."
  - the watsonx TTM forecast silently fell back to linear regression; it now logs the
    failure and tags the result with `ttm_fallback_reason` (`watsonx_not_configured`
    vs `watsonx_error: ...`).
  - the `terraform` env-var build and the `get_collector_health` advisory fallbacks
    (downstream device count, collector-down history) now log before degrading.
- Added module loggers to `event_correlation`, `forecasting`, and `terraform`.
- **Composite workflows no longer swallow sub-step failures silently.** In `triage`,
  `health_check`/`diagnose`, and `capacity_plan`, eight bare
  `except Exception: pass / continue / = None` blocks now log via the audit logger and
  surface the failure: the higher-signal ones (blast radius, health score, datasource
  and instance fetches) append to the response `warnings`, and the per-metric
  `capacity_plan` analyses (forecast, trend, seasonality, change points) attach a
  `<field>_error` alongside the `None` so a failure is distinguishable from "no data."
- **The empty/null-id import silent-failure guard now covers all eight `import_*`
  tools.** Previously only `import_datasource` detected a 200 response with no id and no
  error (the wrong-definition-format case); the other seven reported `imported_id: null`
  as a success. All eight now route through a shared `_import_result_response` helper
  that returns `IMPORT_SILENT_FAILURE` for that shape.
- **Registration / discoverability drift.**
  - `LM_MCP_CATEGORIES=workflow` (the documented Cursor 40-tool-cap workaround) silently
    dropped `detect_site_outage` and `audit_network_monitoring_coverage`: the curated
    `WORKFLOW_TOOLS` set was never updated when those v3.8.0 composites landed. Both are
    now included.
  - `search_tools` searched only the core `TOOLS` list, so the 29 AWX/watsonx/Terraform
    tools were unsearchable even when configured (and `search_tools(category="ansible"
    |"terraform"|"watsonx")` always returned empty). It now builds its corpus the same
    way the server advertises tools.
  - `recover_device` and `collect_device_config` mutate the portal but lacked a write
    prefix, so they executed with no audit-log entry; `recover_`/`collect_` were added to
    `WRITE_TOOL_PREFIXES`.
  - Removed the dead, unreachable `ops.get_audit_logs` duplicate (the registry routes
    `get_audit_logs` to the more specific `audit.get_audit_logs`).
  - Corrected stale tool counts in the README (272/225/220 -> 280/240/280).

### Changed

- `add_widget` and `update_widget` expose a `row` parameter and treat `column_index`,
  `row_span`, and `col_span` as 1-indexed grid coordinates clamped to the 12-column
  grid. Omitting all placement on `add_widget` lets the portal auto-place the widget
  below existing ones.
- `create_report` and `update_report_schedule` take a cron schedule string plus
  `schedule_timezone` (replacing the prior nested-dict / `schedule_type` /
  `schedule_enabled` parameters); `get_scheduled_reports` returns the `schedule` string
  and `schedule_timezone`.

### Verified

- Live-portal read validation of the `widgetsConfig` shape (dict keyed by widget id ->
  {col, row, sizex, sizey}) on dashboards 3 and 15, and of the report
  `schedule`/`scheduleTimezone` flat-string shape on reports 1, 2, and 6.
- Live-portal write validation: a widget placed via `add_widget` persisted its position
  and an `export_dashboard` -> `create_dashboard` clone round-tripped its widget;
  `run_report` reached the executions endpoint and a cron written via
  `update_report_schedule` stored `schedule="0 8 * * 1"` + `scheduleTimezone` (report 6,
  restored afterward).
- New regression tests assert the degraded/unavailable surfacing for the three
  silent-failure fixes (collector down-signal, blast-radius alert lookup, remediation
  audit read).
- Full test suite green; ruff check and format clean. Dashboard and report mock fixtures
  corrected from the prior list / `{"count": N}` / nested-dict-schedule shapes to the
  real API shapes.

## [3.8.3] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **DiagnosticSource and RemediationSource read tools return HTTP 415.** `get_diagnosticsources`, `get_diagnosticsource`, `get_remediationsources`, and `get_remediationsource` were calling the Santaba UI's internal Exchange Toolbox endpoint (`POST /exchange/toolbox/exchange{Diagnostic,Remediation}Sources` with body `{}`). Per LM's internal Action Source API spec, that path with POST is the CREATE verb -- not LIST or GET -- so the API rejected the malformed CREATE payload with 415. Repointed all four tools to the public REST surface `GET /setting/{diagnostic,remediation}sources` and `GET /setting/{diagnostic,remediation}sources/{id}`. This is the same path family every other source tool uses (`get_datasources`, `get_configsources`, etc.) and that LogicMonitor's official PowerShell module canonicalizes for these resources. Filtering is now pushed server-side via the standard LM `filter=name~"x"` query parameter and pagination via `size`/`offset`. `[PREVIEW]` markers removed from the four tools -- they are first-class public reads.
- **LMv1 HMAC signature drift on empty-body requests.** The body-signing path in `client/api.py` checked `if json_body` (truthiness), so an empty dict `{}` was treated as missing and signed against `""` while httpx put `"{}"` on the wire. The mismatch produced 401 on LMv1 portals every empty-body POST/PATCH (`recover_device`, the broken Exchange Toolbox readers above, and anything future that passes `json_body={}`). Bearer-auth portals ignore body in the signature so the bug remained dormant. Fix uses `if json_body is not None`, applied to both `request()` (line 299) and `ingest_post()` (line 520).
- **`calculate_error_budget` JSON-decode crash on inner errors.** When the inner `calculate_availability` call returned a human-readable `"Error: ...\nSuggestion: ..."` envelope (now reachable through the device-lookup fix below), `calculate_error_budget` did a raw `json.loads(avail_result[0].text)` and raised `JSONDecodeError`, which propagated as `"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"`. Routed through `call_sub_tool` so the inner failure surfaces cleanly. Same hardening v3.8.2 applied to workflow composites; `calculate_error_budget` was missed in that sweep.
- **`calculate_availability` device-lookup silent failure.** A 404 or 403 on the device lookup proceeded silently with unfiltered alerts, producing availability numbers for a different device set (or every device in the portal). Replaced the bare `except Exception: pass` with an `LMError`-only catch that returns a structured `DEVICE_LOOKUP_FAILED` envelope.
- **`ingest_logs` and `push_metrics` missing `@require_write_permission`.** Both tools push data into the portal but the decorator was absent, so `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=false` did not gate them. Added the decorator and converted the bare `[TextContent(text="Error: ...")]` validation returns to the new `validation_error()` helper for canonical envelope shape.
- **`baselines.save_baseline` and `compare_to_baseline` bare error returns.** Both functions returned `[TextContent(text=f"Error: {e}")]` from their outer except blocks, bypassing `handle_error()`. No structured envelope, no logged stack trace, no `error: true`/`code` fields. Replaced with `return handle_error(e)`.

### Added

- **`lm_mcp.tools.call_sub_tool`** (moved and renamed from `_call_sub_tool` in `workflows.py`). Public helper that calls a sub-handler, parses the JSON response, and raises a clean `RuntimeError` on error envelopes or non-JSON bodies. Now usable from non-workflow composites without copy-paste or circular imports.
- **`lm_mcp.tools.validation_error(code, message, suggestion?)`** helper for canonical input-validation responses. Used by `ingest_logs` and `push_metrics`; available to every tool.
- New regression tests for each of the six fix sites (~15 tests total).

### Tracked Follow-ups

The pre-release audit surfaced additional consistency and silent-failure gaps that are not bundled in v3.8.3 to keep the diff focused. Each will get a dedicated PR:

- Pagination compliance for ~17 list endpoints missing `offset`/`has_more` (sdts, netscans, oids, services, alert_rules, escalations, integrations, device_groups, website_groups, dashboard_groups, collector_groups, roles, batchjobs, api_tokens, device_eventsources, device_logsources, dashboard_widgets).
- Filter-convention rollout: add raw `filter` escape hatch to list tools that currently accept only typed filters.
- Naming: `list_sdts` -> `get_sdts`, `list_session_history` -> `get_session_history` (one release with alias).
- List/singular field parity expansion (`get_devices`, `get_alerts`, `get_collectors`, `logsources` `display_name`).
- Session singleton thread-safety for HTTP transport.
- Method-gated retry on POST 5xx in the client.
- `_LM_ERROR_PATTERNS` coverage: add 415, malformed-enum, and empty-body 400 patterns.
- Workflows.py silent-failure cleanup (~20 bare `except Exception: pass` sites in `triage`, `diagnose`, `audit_network_monitoring_coverage`, `capacity_plan`).
- Expand `IMPORT_SILENT_FAILURE` guard to the 7 sibling `import_*` tools.
- `export_topologysource` missing despite create/import/update/delete being present.

### Verified

- Full test suite passing (1810+ tests).
- Ruff check + format clean.
- LM PowerShell module (`logicmonitor/lm-powershell-module`) cross-referenced as the canonical public-API path source for diagnosticsources and remediationsources.

## [3.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- `_call_sub_tool` (composite dispatch helper) no longer leaks a cryptic `JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` when a sub-tool returns an error response. `format_response` renders error dicts as human-readable `"Error: <message>\nSuggestion: <suggestion>"` text, which is not JSON. `_call_sub_tool` now detects that shape and raises a clean `RuntimeError` carrying the underlying message. Benefits every composite (`triage`, `diagnose`, `health_check`, `capacity_plan`, `portal_overview`, `update_logicmodule`, `detect_site_outage`, `audit_network_monitoring_coverage`), not just the one that surfaced the bug. Also handles truly unexpected non-JSON bodies by surfacing a 200-char snippet for debugging.
- `detect_site_outage` no longer aborts the entire CollectorDown signal when a single collector-health probe fails. Each `collector_id` is now probed under its own try/except; failures accumulate into a single aggregate warning (`"N/M collector health probes failed: collector_id=X: <error>; ..."`) while the remaining collectors continue to be inspected. Surfaced during the v3.8.1 portal smoke test on Ryan's portal: 2 of 4 collectors returned errors (likely orphaned references to deleted collectors) and truncated `collectors_inspected` to 2 entries.

### Added

- Four direct unit tests for `_call_sub_tool` covering happy-path JSON, `"Error:"`-formatted text, non-JSON non-error body, and `{"error": True}` dict shape.
- `test_partial_collector_failures_do_not_abort_loop` covers the multi-collector partial-failure path end-to-end.

### Verified

- Full 1784-test suite passing (4 new `_call_sub_tool` + 1 new partial-failure test + 1 updated assertion).
- Ruff check + format clean.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- `detect_site_outage` now correctly enumerates the collectors serving a device group. Previously, `_collector_ids_from_devices` looked for `currentCollectorId` / `preferredCollectorId` on device records, but the formatted `get_devices` sub-tool response renames that field to `collector_id`. The mismatch meant the CollectorDown signal was always zero for the composite when called through the normal dispatch path. Surfaced during the v3.8.0 smoke test on Ryan's portal (500 devices in group 1 reported `collectors_serving_group: 0`). The helper now checks `collector_id` first, with fallback to the raw API field names so raw-data callers still work.
- `_count_dead_devices` now counts LM `hostStatus=2` (dead-collector) in addition to `hostStatus=1` (dead). Both indicate devices not reporting metrics; counting only one under-reported device silence. Also reads the formatted-response `status` field before falling back to the raw `hostStatus`, matching the shape that arrives from the composite's sub-tool dispatch.

### Added

- Six direct unit tests for the `_collector_ids_from_devices` and `_count_dead_devices` helpers covering formatted shape, raw API shape, absent fields, and alertStatus-only fallback.

### Verified

- Full 1779-test suite passing (6 new helper tests).
- Ruff check + format clean.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

Networking intelligence release. Eight new tools for interface metrics, NetFlow intelligence, alert burst detection, link flap identification, UPS/PDU event filtering, enriched collector health, site-outage composition, and coverage audit. Answers the class of networking questions operators ask every day and, crucially, detects site-outage signatures (collector down + mass interface-down + UPS on-battery + downstream device silence) that generic AIOps correlation misses.

**Network primitives (5):**

- `get_interface_metrics(device_id, interface, metrics, hours_back)` -- pulls per-interface time-series metrics (default datapoints: RxRate, TxRate, ErrorsIn, ErrorsOut, DiscardsIn, DiscardsOut, InterfaceStatus). Resolves the Interface-family DataSource and instance from an interface name substring, then fetches datapoints via the existing metrics endpoint. Returns structured errors (`INTERFACE_DATASOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `INTERFACE_NOT_FOUND`) with available-instance suggestions to aid discovery.
- `get_top_talkers(exporter_device_id, hours_back, n, group_by, min_bytes)` -- ranks NetFlow flows for an exporter. Group by `src_ip`, `dst_ip`, `application`, `protocol`, or `src_dst_pair`. Client-side aggregation with percentage-of-total reporting. Graceful "no flows in window" path when the exporter is not configured or the window is empty.
- `detect_alert_burst(group_id, device, datasource_pattern, window_seconds, min_alerts, min_devices, hours_back, severity)` -- sliding-window mass-event detector. Buckets alerts by DataSource, identifies windows where alert count and distinct device count exceed thresholds. Hard-capped at 5000 alerts per window with truncation warning. Used by the site-outage composite but also answers general "did a bunch of things break at once?" queries (DDoS, switch cascade, firmware push failures).
- `get_link_flaps(group_id, device, hours_back, min_transitions, interface_pattern)` -- identifies interfaces with repeated up/down transitions. Regex-matches interface-family DataSources against alert stream, groups by (device, instance), counts transitions, returns top-50 flappers.
- `get_power_events(group_id, device, hours_back, severity, patterns)` -- UPS/PDU alert filter. Default patterns cover APC, Liebert, Eaton, UPS, PDU, Battery, PowerSupply, Power_. Client-side substring match on `dataSourceName` and `alertName`. Returns per-pattern match counts for quick attribution.

**Enriched collector status (1):**

- `get_collector_health(collector_id, collector_group_id, include_history, history_days)` -- augments the thin `get_collectors` with time-since-last-contact, downstream device count (via `/device/devices?filter=currentCollectorId:{id}`), active CollectorDown alert detection, and optional CollectorDown history over a lookback window. Now the preferred query when investigating potential outages.

**Composite workflows (2):**

- `detect_site_outage(group_id, window_seconds, hours_back, detail_level)` -- the headline tool. Chains four signals into a single verdict with confidence score (0-100): CollectorDown on any collector serving the group (+40), mass-interface-down burst (+25), UPS/PDU power events (+25), elevated dead-device count (+10). Verdict thresholds: `>= 70` site_outage_detected, `>= 40` possible_site_outage, `< 40` no_outage_signature. Returns affected scope, triggered signals, actionable recommendations, and per-signal detail available in `full` mode.
- `audit_network_monitoring_coverage(group_id)` -- portal coverage audit. Inventories devices and collectors, counts SNMP-credentialed devices, NetFlow exporters, power-monitored devices, and collector health. Produces prioritized gap list with specific onboarding recommendations (e.g., "0 UPS devices onboarded -- add APC_UPS_Battery or equivalent to enable power-event detection"). Turns prerequisite gaps into actionable consulting output.

### Rationale

The Edwin AI product recently failed to correlate a customer power outage as a single incident. The MCP had a parallel gap: no primitives for interface-level metric queries, NetFlow aggregation beyond a raw flow list, alert burst detection, link flap counting, UPS event filtering, or collector-health enrichment, and no composite that combined these into an outage verdict. This release closes the gap with eight read-only tools that run alongside existing correlation tools and composites. The site-outage composite specifically encodes the signal pattern that generic temporal correlation misses: a collector losing power at the same moment 40 interfaces on 8 switches drop and 3 UPS units switch to battery is one incident, not 51.

### Changed

- Tool count: 243 -> 251 LM tools. Overall surface (LM + AAP + Terraform + watsonx): 272 -> 280.
- `collectors` and `workflows` tool-categories indexes updated with the new entries. Added a `networking` category listing the five primitives.
- Composite dispatch remains unchanged -- all new tools live in the LM dispatch path.

### Verified

- 1773 unit tests passing (80 new).
- Ruff lint and format clean across `src` and `tests`.
- No `hostGroupIds~` regressions in new code (all group-scoped queries use `resolve_group_filter` per `docs/lessons.md`).

## [3.7.3] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- `create_http_integration` now copies the active-lifecycle `url`, `method`, `payload`, `payloadFormat`, and `headers` into each enabled lifecycle that does not already override them. LM rejects a create with `ackUrl is null or empty, ackMethod is null or empty, ...` when an enabled lifecycle lacks these fields; the LM web UI silently defaults them to the active values, but the v3.7.1 MCP tool did not. The live smoke test (`scripts/smoke_http_integration.py`) against a real portal was failing as a result. Explicit per-lifecycle overrides (`ack_url`, `clear_method`, etc.) still take precedence. Lifecycles not listed in `enabled_lifecycles` are left untouched.
- `scripts/smoke_http_integration.py` now posts to `https://example.com/lm-mcp-smoke` instead of `https://example.invalid/smoke`. LM does a DNS check on create; the IANA-reserved `.invalid` TLD fails resolution and surfaces as "Unknown Host" even though the webhook is never actually invoked during create. `example.com` resolves (owned by IANA for docs/examples) and accepts POSTs harmlessly.
- Smoke script now prints the raw tool response on failure instead of crashing with `JSONDecodeError` when the tool returned an error string.

### Verified

- End-to-end live smoke test (create, get, patch, delete) now passes against Ryan's portal.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Jackson-aware 4xx error translation**. `_raise_for_status` in the HTTP client now matches LogicMonitor's raw Jackson deserialization errors (`Cannot construct instance of ...$Period`, `Cannot deserialize value of type ...ArrayList<...Recipient...> from Object`, `invalid recipient for stage N`, `admin<N> is not found`, `invalid method <...> for type ARBITRARY`) against a small translation table and rewrites them into actionable `LMError.message` + `LMError.suggestion` values. The raw server text is preserved on `LMError.details` so debugging context is not lost. Five starter patterns; the table is designed to grow as new shapes are seen in the wild.
- **`LMError.details`** -- new optional field on the base exception. Surfaced by `to_dict()` when set. Carries the raw untranslated server message for callers that want to inspect it (logs, debuggers, follow-up tooling).
- **Integration-shorthand recipient** in `create_escalation_chain` and `update_escalation_chain` destinations. Recipients of the form `{type: "integration", integration_name: "<display name>", admin: "<username>"}` are rewritten to the canonical `{type: "admin", addr: "<username>", method: "<display name>"}` form before the request is sent. `method`/`addr` aliases are also accepted. `integration_id` alone is explicitly rejected with an actionable error -- the display name and owning admin must be passed (use `get_integration` to look them up).

### Rationale

Wiring LogicMonitor escalation chains used to fail with multi-line Java stack traces like "Cannot construct instance of com.santaba.server.servlet.rest.v3.pojos.setting.alert.RestEscalatingChainV3$Period" because the LM v3 API forwards Jackson's raw deserialization errors to API clients. That wording names internal POJOs and teaches callers nothing about the fix. After v3.7.2, the same 400 response comes back as "destinations[].period must be null or a Period object" plus a concrete example, and the integration-shorthand rewrite means callers never have to discover the non-obvious `admin+method` form in the first place.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Custom HTTP Delivery integration CRUD on `/setting/integrations`:
  - `get_integrations(name_filter, type_filter, limit)` -- list integrations with optional `type:"http"` exact-match and `name~` substring filters (LM v3 requires exact quoting on type, wildcards are not supported there).
  - `get_integration(integration_id)` -- full passthrough of the LM definition (field set varies by integration type; `password` and `oAuthClientSecret` are server-masked).
  - `create_http_integration(name, url, ...)` -- creates a `type="http"` integration. Exposes `description`, `http_method`, `headers`, `alert_body`, `alert_body_format`, `alert_data_type`, `username`, `password`, `enabled_lifecycles` (subset of active/ack/clear/update/actionNotes/updateData), per-lifecycle overrides for ack/clear/update, and `extra_fields` for OAuth credentials, `actionNotes*`, `updateData*`, and the `extra` UI metadata blob.
  - `update_http_integration(integration_id, ...)` -- PATCH partial update; only fields explicitly provided are sent.
  - `delete_integration(integration_id)` -- works for any integration type.
  - `headers` accepts a plain `{name: value}` dict (converted to LM's native `list[{HeaderName: value}]` form) or a friendly `[{name, value}, ...]` list.
- `scripts/smoke_http_integration.py` -- one-shot live smoke test that creates a throwaway integration pointing at `https://example.invalid/smoke`, reads it back, patches it, then deletes it. Run post-merge with `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true uv run python scripts/smoke_http_integration.py`.

### Rationale

Before v3.7.1, wiring LogicMonitor to any webhook-style destination (Azure Sentinel, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Splunk, custom pipelines) required manual UI steps at Settings -> Integrations because the MCP server had no tool for the integration resource. Only `create_alert_rule` and (post-v3.7.0) `create_escalation_chain` worked via MCP. This release closes the gap so a single MCP session can wire the full alert-delivery path end-to-end.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- `get_recipient_groups` and `get_recipient_group` now read the LM v3 API's `groupName` field (falling back to `name` for legacy portal responses). Previously these tools read `item.get("name")`, which LM leaves unset on recipient-group reads, so the MCP response surfaced `name: null` for groups that do exist in the portal. The obsolete `group_type` field is no longer surfaced -- it is not part of the v3 `RecipientGroup` model.
- `create_recipient_group` and `update_recipient_group` now post `groupName` to match the LM v3 model. The previous payload used `name`, which the API silently ignored.

### Added

- `create_recipient_group(..., recipients=[...])` accepts a list of Recipient objects at creation time, eliminating the prior two-step create-then-populate workflow. Each recipient is `{type, method, addr, contact}` with `type` and `method` required.
- `update_recipient_group(..., recipients=[...])` accepts a replacement recipient list.
- `get_recipient_groups(..., detail=True)` issues one follow-up GET per group to attach the full recipient list. Off by default to avoid N+1 API calls.

### Changed

- `create_escalation_chain` and `update_escalation_chain` input schemas now describe the Chain object shape (`{type, period, stages}`) and document that `stages` is a list of stage arrays where each stage is a list of Recipient objects. A concrete example covers routing alerts to a Custom HTTP Delivery integration via `{type: "admin", addr: "<username>", method: "<integration display name>"}` -- the reverse-engineered working form. The same guidance is mirrored into the tool docstrings for clients that don't render schema examples.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `get_reference(category, name, list)`: universal read-only tool that mirrors MCP Resource content (schemas, enums, filters, syntax, guides) over the Tool primitive. Targets clients without full Resource support -- GitHub Copilot cloud agent, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cline. Pass `list=true` (or call with no args) to discover the available (category, name) pairs.
- `get_workflow(name, list, arguments)`: universal read-only tool that mirrors MCP Prompt content for clients without Prompt support. Returns the rendered workflow guidance text. Prefer the composite workflow tools (`triage`, `diagnose`, `health_check`, `capacity_plan`, `portal_overview`) when they exist -- those execute the procedure rather than returning guidance.
- `universal_reference` entry in the tool-categories guide for `search_tools` discovery.
- Seven single-word aliases in `_WORKFLOW_ALIASES` (`schema`, `filter`, `syntax`, `reference`, `guide`, `workflow`, `prompt`) route `search_tools` queries to the two new tools.

### Changed

- `prompts/registry.py`: hoisted the `templates` dict from inside `get_prompt_messages` to a module-level `_TEMPLATES` constant so `tools/reference.py` can import it without duplication. `get_prompt_messages` behavior is unchanged (same signature, same `ValueError` on unknown prompt).
- Tool count: 236 -> 238 (LM), 265 -> 267 (overall: 238 LM + 18 AAP + 10 Terraform + 1 watsonx).
- README release notes consolidated into this CHANGELOG; README now shows only the current version with a link here for full history.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `LM_MCP_CATEGORIES` env var: filter the visible tool surface by logical category. Categories: `read`, `write`, `delete`, `export`, `import`, `session`, `workflow`. Composes by intersection with `LM_ENABLED_TOOLS`/`LM_DISABLED_TOOLS` -- only narrows, never expands. Useful for clients with tool-count limits (e.g., Cursor's 40-tool cap) and for restricting agent surface to read-only or workflow operations. Default behavior unchanged when env var is unset.
- `update_logicmodule(type, id, changes, mode='preview')` workflow tool: safe partial update for LogicMonitor source types (configsource, datasource, eventsource, logsource, propertysource, topologysource). Exports the current full definition, deep-merges your `changes` onto it, validates required fields, and returns a dry-run diff (`mode='preview'`, default) or applies the merged definition (`mode='apply'`). Prevents the full-replace blanking footgun that has caused two prior production incidents.

### Changed

- The 6 raw `update_<source>` tools (`update_configsource`, `update_datasource`, `update_eventsource`, `update_logsource`, `update_propertysource`, `update_topologysource`) now require `confirm=true` to proceed. Without confirmation they return `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` with a pointer to `update_logicmodule` for safe partial updates. This is a soft-breaking change for direct API users who relied on the old default; the rationale is that two prior incidents wiped Groovy scripts via these tools, and LLM-driven callers cannot be relied upon to read docstrings about full-replace semantics.
- `handle_error` now logs unexpected exceptions via `logger.exception()` before returning the sanitized response. Previously, JSONDecodeError / KeyError / ValueError and other non-`LMError` exceptions were silently swallowed without leaving a stack trace, making debugging impossible. LMError instances continue to propagate without logging (they're expected).

### Internal

- New module `src/lm_mcp/categories.py` with annotation-driven categorization plus a curated `WORKFLOW_TOOLS` frozenset.
- `_filter_tools` (server.py), `execute_tool` rejection (server.py), and `check_required_tools` (workflows.py) all honor the new categories filter.
- Tool count: 235 -> 236 (added `update_logicmodule`).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- `delete_configsource`, `delete_eventsource`, `delete_logsource`, `delete_propertysource`, `delete_topologysource` -- delete operations for all LogicModule source types.
- `handle_conflict` and `fields_to_preserve` parameters on all `import_*` tools for safer imports into existing resources.

### Fixed

- `create_*` and `update_*` tools now auto-normalize field names from LM Exchange format and `snake_case` to the REST API's `camelCase`.
- Import tools auto-inject the LM Exchange `type` envelope field when missing.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- REST API `create_*` and `update_*` tools for all LogicModule source types -- ConfigSource, EventSource, LogSource, TopologySource, PropertySource. Enables export -> modify -> update workflows without delete/recreate.

### Fixed

- `update_datasource` description now correctly documents full-replace semantics (name and displayName required).
- All `import_*` tool descriptions clarify LM Exchange format requirement and direct users to `create_*` for REST API format.
- All `export_*` tool descriptions reference both `create_*` and `update_*` for round-tripping.
- Version synced across all locations (was drifted since v3.2.0).

## [3.1.0] - [3.3.0] - 2026-03-25 - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Terraform IaC integration -- 10 tools (later 11 in v3.4.x) for plan/apply/state/import/HCL generation.
- HuggingFace local Granite fallback for TTM forecasting and NL summaries via local models.
- `[huggingface]` optional dependency group (`torch`, `transformers`, `granite-tsfm`, `accelerate`).
- Device config retrieval and audit tools (`get_device_config`, `get_device_config_version`, `collect_device_config`).
- `create_propertysource` REST API tool.
- 5-way dispatch (Session, AWX, WatsonX, Terraform, LM) with graceful degradation when optional integrations are not configured.
- AI inference priority chain: watsonx.ai API > HuggingFace local > statistical/linear fallback.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- IBM watsonx.ai integration (optional, requires `WATSONX_API_KEY`).
- Granite TTM time-series forecasting via `method="ttm"` on `forecast_metric`.
- Granite NL summaries via `summarize=true` on composite workflow tools.
- `watsonx_summarize` standalone tool for ad-hoc data summarization.
- `[ibm]` optional dependency group (`ibm-watsonx-ai`, `pandas`).
- 4-way dispatch (Session, AWX, WatsonX, LM).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- `create_user`, `update_user`, `delete_user` -- full CRUD for user accounts via `/setting/admins` API. Delete fetches username before removal for audit-friendly responses.
- `create_collector_group`, `update_collector_group`, `delete_collector_group` -- collector group management. Delete blocks if collectors are still assigned. Update merges custom properties with existing values.
- `update_ops_note`, `delete_ops_note` -- ops note write operations. Update supports note text, tags, and device/group scopes.
- `update_dashboard_group` -- update dashboard group name, description, or parent ID via PATCH.
- `update_sdt` -- modify scheduled downtimes using fetch-modify-PUT pattern to preserve unmodified fields.
- Tool categories index updated to include all new tools.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Portal URL links in single-resource detail responses (`get_device`, `get_device_group`, `get_alert_details`, `get_dashboard`, `get_website`). Each response now includes a `portal_url` field linking directly to the resource in the LM portal UI.
- HTTPS transport support via `LM_HTTP_SSL_CERTFILE`, `LM_HTTP_SSL_KEYFILE`, and `LM_HTTP_SSL_KEYFILE_PASSWORD` environment variables. When configured, the HTTP transport starts with TLS via Uvicorn.
- `portal_url()` shared helper in tools init for constructing LM portal UI links.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- `get_alerts` now supports `group_id` parameter to filter alerts by device group. Resolves the group ID to its `fullPath` and uses the `monitorObjectGroups~` filter, which works reliably for Kubernetes clusters and all other device groups.
- `get_alerts` now supports `device_id` parameter to filter alerts by device/resource ID using `monitorObjectId:` filter.
- `resolve_group_filter()` shared helper resolves a group ID to a `monitorObjectGroups~` filter clause via a single API call.
- Alert filter documentation (`filters.py`) now includes `hostGroupIds`, `monitorObjectId`, and `monitorObjectGroups` fields with examples.

### Fixed

- `correlate_alerts`, `get_alert_statistics`, and `score_alert_noise` now use `monitorObjectGroups~` instead of `hostGroupIds~` for group filtering. The `hostGroupIds~` filter does not reliably restrict results to the target group in the LM API.
- `correlate_alerts` and `score_alert_noise` now sanitize the `device` parameter through `sanitize_filter_value()`, matching `get_alerts` behavior.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `get_device_group` — Fetch full device group detail including `appliesTo` expression and `parentId`
- `get_device_eventsources` — List EventSources applied to a device with alerting status
- `update_device_eventsource` — Enable/disable alerting for an EventSource on a device (write-protected)
- `bulk_delete_devices` — Batch delete up to 100 devices with K8S warnings, soft or hard delete (write-protected)
- `update_collector` — Update collector group, description, failback, and escalation chain (write-protected)
- `delete_collector` — Delete a collector with guardrail blocking deletion if devices are still assigned (write-protected)
- `recover_device` — Restore soft-deleted devices via PATCH with `recover=true` parameter (write-protected)
- `safe_total()` helper for handling LM API negative total sentinel values in paginated responses

### Fixed

- `get_devices` status filter restored to numeric codes (`hostStatus:1` for dead) — the v3 API rejects string values like `hostStatus:dead` with "invalid filter"
- `get_devices` and `get_alerts` no longer return negative totals when the API response is truncated — `safe_total()` applies `abs()` to sentinel values
- `score_alert_noise` weight formula corrected from `repeat_ratio * 3000` / `flap_ratio * 3000` to `* 30` — scores were pegged at 100 for any normal alert volume

### Changed

- `calculate_availability` now post-filters results to the target device, preventing unrelated devices from polluting calculations; added optional `device_name` parameter and safe uptime floor (`max(0.0, ...)`)
- `delete_device` warns when deleting K8S-managed devices (deviceType=8) since Argus may recreate them; includes deleted device audit context
- `update_device` warns when `host_group_ids` changes may not persist on K8S-managed devices
- `get_device_groups` now includes `parentId` and `appliesTo` in list results
- Tool count: 216 -> 223 (205 LM + 18 AAP)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- CORS default changed from `*` (allow all) to empty string (no CORS by default). HTTP transport users must now explicitly set `LM_CORS_ORIGINS` to enable cross-origin requests.
- `AWX_VERIFY_SSL` default changed from `false` to `true` in setup script
- Expanded ruff lint rules to full recommended set (E/F/I/N/W/UP/B/SIM/RUF)
- Added mypy type checking to CI (non-blocking)
- Pinned uv to 0.9.27 in Dockerfile and CI workflows
- Added Docker layer caching to release workflow

### Fixed

- Setup script (`scripts/add-mcp-to-project.sh`) no longer uses hardcoded path; auto-detects project root

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `create_sdt` and `bulk_create_device_sdt` map Device* SDT type names to Resource* before POST, fixing 400 "Invalid type" errors on the v3 API which renamed Device* to Resource* for SDT create endpoints

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- `create_sdt` expanded from 2 types (DeviceSDT, DeviceGroupSDT) to all 13 LM API SDT types
- `datasource_id` parameter on `create_sdt` for DeviceDataSourceSDT type
- Generalized Device-prefixed type handling so `deviceId` is sent for all Device* types
- Improved error messages with cloud resource workaround guidance

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- `update_device_group` tool for modifying group name, description, AppliesTo, properties, and alerting state with property merging

### Removed

- 10 action chain/rule tools removed (not present on v3 API swagger)
- Action sources guide category renamed to remediation (7 tools retained)

### Changed

- Tool count: 225 -> 216 (198 LM + 18 AAP)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- 5 composite workflow tools (`triage`, `health_check`, `capacity_plan`, `portal_overview`, `diagnose`) combining multiple sub-tools into single calls with summary/full detail levels and partial failure handling
- `search_tools` for keyword-based progressive discovery across all 225 tools
- `calculate_error_budget` for SLO error budget tracking
- `execute_remediation`, `get_remediation_status`, `get_remediation_history` for RemediationSource execution with 8-point pre-execution safety checklist
- Holt-Winters forecasting with auto-selection between linear and exponential smoothing
- IQR and MAD anomaly detection methods alongside existing z-score
- Prediction intervals on forecast results
- Metric presets auto-configure analysis parameters by datapoint name
- 15 enriched prompts with composite shortcuts and argument parsing
- 2 new resources (best-practices, example-responses)
- Common mistake notes on 6 frequently misused tool descriptions

### Changed

- Scoring tools return structured best-practice recommendations and anti-patterns when thresholds are breached
- Tool count: 215 -> 225 (207 LM + 18 AAP), prompt count: 14 -> 15, resource count: 24 -> 26

## [1.9.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- `get_widget`, `update_widget`, `delete_widget` use flat `/dashboard/widgets/{id}` endpoint instead of nested path that returned 404
- `add_widget` applies deviceSLA default fields (daysInWeek, periodInOneDay, displayType, calculationMethod, unmonitoredTimeAlertStatus) that the portal UI sets automatically
- `add_widget` remaps common field name aliases (`deviceGroupFullPath` -> `groupName`, `html` -> `content`) to prevent silent data loss from LM API discarding unknown fields
- `get_dashboards` prefers `numOfWidgets` over unreliable `widgetsConfig` for widget count

### Changed

- `add_widget` description documents text widget `content` key and deviceSLA required fields

## [1.9.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Action Sources integration: 14 tools for diagnostic and remediation workflows
  - Action chains: get, create, update, delete
  - Action rules: get, create, update, delete
  - Diagnostic sources: list, get details
  - Remediation sources: list, get details
- All Action Sources tools marked `[PREVIEW]` — API endpoints are not yet GA in LM portals

### Removed

- Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) tools removed from deployed package (20 tools)
  - EDA required standalone infrastructure not available through LM Portal
  - Source code preserved in `contrib/eda/` for future reference
  - `/lm-eda` skill removed

### Changed

- Tool count: 221 -> 215 (197 LM + 18 AAP)
- Skill count: 7 -> 6
- Dispatch simplified from 4-way (session -> EDA -> AWX -> LM) to 3-way (session -> AWX -> LM)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- EDA create tools now include required `organization_id` parameter (default 1 = "Default" org)
- `create_eda_event_stream` now requires `eda_credential_id` parameter (EDA API requirement)
- `create_eda_project` sends `organization_id` in request body
- `create_eda_activation` sends `organization_id` in request body

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Event-Driven Ansible integration (20 tools) for automated event response
- EdaClient HTTP client with Bearer token auth, retry logic, and error mapping
- Activation management: list, get, create, enable, disable, restart, delete
- Activation instance monitoring with log retrieval
- EDA project management: list, get, create, sync from Git
- Rulebook queries: list, get (populated via project sync)
- Event stream management: list, get, create, delete
- Write-protected tools: create/enable/disable/restart/delete activations, create/sync projects, create/delete event streams
- `test_eda_connection` tool for verifying EDA Controller connectivity

- `update_device_instance` — Update instance properties (display name, description, monitoring, alerting)
- `delete_device_instance` — Delete a datasource instance from a device

### Fixed

- AAP check_mode (dry run) now sends `job_type: "check"` to the controller, preventing accidental execution during dry runs

### Changed

- Tool count: 198 -> 221 (183 LM + 18 AAP + 20 EDA)
- Skill count: 6 -> 7
- Tool categories guide updated with "eda" domain
- Write audit logging expanded with enable/disable/restart/sync prefixes

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-19

- Write-protected tools: launch_job, launch_workflow, cancel_job, relaunch_job (require LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true)
- Jinja2 injection protection on all extra_vars inputs
- `/lm-remediate` Claude Code skill: 10-step diagnosis-to-remediation workflow

- Prompt count: 13 -> 14
- Skill count: 5 -> 6
- Tool categories guide updated with "ansible" domain

## [1.7.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **`update_device` custom_properties merge** — Custom properties are now merged with existing properties instead of replacing them. Prevents silent data loss when updating a subset of custom properties on a device.
- **`update_device_property` create-on-404** — Falls back to POST (create) when PUT returns 404 for a property that doesn't exist yet. Matches the tool description "Update or create a device property".
- **`get_devices` filter validation for dot-notation fields** — Custom property filter queries like `customProperties.name:"env"` no longer fail schema validation. Dot-notation fields are now skipped during field validation since the LM API handles them natively.
- **Import tools string definition handling** — All import tools (`import_datasource`, `import_configsource`, etc.) and `post_multipart()` now handle definitions that arrive as JSON strings instead of dicts, preventing double-serialization of complex embedded content (e.g., Groovy scripts with escape characters).

### Added

- **`update_datasource`** — Update an existing DataSource definition via PUT.
- **`delete_datasource`** — Delete a DataSource definition by ID with confirmation.
- **`hostname_filter` on `get_devices`** — Filter devices by hostname or IP address (the `name` field). The existing `name_filter` parameter searches `displayName`; the new parameter searches the actual hostname/IP.
- **`overwrite` on `create_datasource`** — When `true`, deletes any existing DataSource with the same name before creating. Provides explicit upsert semantics without hidden behavior.

### Changed

- **`update_device` description** — Now documents merge behavior for custom properties.
- **`get_devices` filter description** — Documents custom property query syntax with proper quoting examples.
- **`get_devices` `name_filter` description** — Clarified as "display name" filter to distinguish from the new `hostname_filter`.

Tool count: 178 -> 180.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **HTTP 200 error body detection** — API client now checks for `errorMessage` + `errorCode` inside HTTP 200 response bodies and raises `LMError` with code `API_ERROR_{errorCode}`. Some LM API endpoints return HTTP 200 with error details in the body instead of using HTTP status codes; these previously passed through silently as success.
- **`add_widget` endpoint URL** — Changed from `/dashboard/dashboards/{id}/widgets` (returns 405) to `/dashboard/widgets`. The `dashboardId` field in the request body specifies which dashboard the widget belongs to.
- **`import_datasource` silent failure detection** — Now detects empty `{}` responses (no `id` or `errorMessage`) and returns an error noting the import may have silently failed, with guidance to use `create_datasource` for REST API format definitions.

### Added

- **`create_datasource`** — Create a DataSource via REST API from a full definition dict. Accepts the same format as `export_datasource` output, enabling round-tripping of exported definitions. Strips `id` from the definition before POST.

### Changed

- **Export/import format documentation** — Updated descriptions for `export_datasource`, `import_datasource`, and `create_datasource` to clarify the difference between REST API format (used by export/create) and LM Exchange format (used by import).
- **`add_widget` description** — Added format guidance for common widget types (bigNumber, cgraph) including GlobMatchToggle objects and aggregateFunction casing.

Tool count: 177 -> 178.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

5 Claude Code skills providing guided multi-step workflows for common LogicMonitor admin operations. Skills ship in the repo so anyone cloning it gets them automatically via `.claude/skills/`.

- **`/lm-triage`** — Alert triage workflow: gathers active alerts and statistics, scores noise level, clusters correlated alerts, performs deep dive with blast radius analysis, checks change correlation, and presents numbered action options (acknowledge, add note, bulk acknowledge). Write actions require explicit confirmation.
- **`/lm-health`** — Device health check: resolves device by ID or name, inventories datasources by category (CPU/Memory/Disk/Network), pulls core metrics, computes health score with decision tree, runs anomaly detection on degraded datasources, checks alert status, device properties, 30-day availability, and topology neighbors. Produces a compiled health report.
- **`/lm-portal`** — Portal-wide health snapshot for shift handoff: alert severity breakdown with trends, collector status (flags any down collectors), active SDT windows, top 5 alert clusters, noise scoring, down device count with collector correlation heuristic. Outputs a GREEN/YELLOW/RED portal status.
- **`/lm-capacity`** — Capacity planning and forecasting: current utilization across CPU/Memory/Disk, trend classification (stable/increasing/decreasing/volatile), seasonality detection, change point detection, breach forecasting with urgency tiers, and baseline comparison. Offers to save baselines with confirmation.
- **`/lm-apm`** — APM trace investigation: service discovery, service profile with properties, service-level RED metrics, operation breakdown sorted by volume, per-operation deep dive, datasource coverage check, and alert correlation. Supports both targeted service investigation and discovery mode.

### Changed

- `.gitignore` updated to track `.claude/skills/` while keeping other `.claude/` contents ignored.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Import tools send wrong Content-Type** — All 8 `import_*` tools now use `multipart/form-data` file upload via `post_multipart()` instead of `application/json` POST. The LM import endpoints require multipart upload; the previous JSON body approach silently failed.
- **Unhandled 4xx status codes returned as success** — `_raise_for_status()` now has a catch-all for 400-499 status codes (400, 405, 409, 415, etc.) that raises `LMError` with code `HTTP_{status}`. Previously these fell through and returned error response bodies as if they were successful results.
- **Export/import format mismatch documented** — Updated docstrings on all export and import functions to clarify that REST API export format differs from LM Exchange format required by import endpoints.

### Added

- **`create_dashboard` template and widget token support** — `create_dashboard` now accepts `widget_tokens` (list of token overrides) and `template` (full dashboard definition from `export_dashboard` to clone from). When using a template, the exported definition is used as the base payload with name overridden and id stripped.
- **`create_dashboard_group`** — Create dashboard groups with optional parent_id and description. Follows the same pattern as `create_website_group`.
- **`delete_dashboard_group`** — Delete dashboard groups by ID. Follows the same pattern as `delete_website_group`.
- **`post_multipart()` client method** — Handles multipart/form-data file uploads for LM import endpoints with proper auth headers and retry logic.

Tool count: 175 -> 177.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

8 APM trace tools for service discovery and RED metrics via the v3 API. APM services are stored as `deviceType:6` devices with `LogicMonitor_APM_Services` and `LogicMonitor_APM_Operations` datasources.

- **`get_trace_services`** — Lists all APM trace services by filtering for deviceType:6. Entry point for discovering which services are instrumented. Supports namespace filtering for substring matching on service names.
- **`get_trace_service`** — Gets full device detail for a specific APM service, including status, groups, and configuration.
- **`get_trace_service_alerts`** — Gets active alerts for an APM service with optional severity filtering (critical, error, warning, info). Bridges traces and alerting.
- **`get_trace_service_datasources`** — Lists datasources applied to an APM service (LogicMonitor_APM_Services, LogicMonitor_APM_Operations, etc.). Required step before querying instances or metric data.
- **`get_trace_operations`** — Lists operation instances (endpoints/routes) for an APM service datasource. Each operation has its own RED metrics.
- **`get_trace_service_metrics`** — Gets service-level time-series data for Duration, ErrorOperationCount, OperationCount, and UniqueOperationCount. Supports time range and datapoint filtering.
- **`get_trace_operation_metrics`** — Gets per-operation RED metrics for a specific endpoint/route. Same API shape as service metrics but scoped to an individual operation instance.
- **`get_trace_service_properties`** — Gets device properties for an APM service including OTel attributes, namespace info, and auto-discovered metadata. Supports name filtering.

Tool count: 167 -> 175. Added "traces" category to tool-categories guide resource.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- ML tool usage guide with detailed examples for capacity forecasting, metric correlation, change point detection, noise scoring, health scoring, and availability calculation
- ML Analysis & Forecasting example prompts section (10 natural language examples)
- Updated project structure with new tool files

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

10 ML/statistical analysis tools using pure-Python implementations (no numpy/scipy dependencies).

- **`forecast_metric`** — Predicts when a metric will breach a threshold. Uses linear regression on historical data to calculate trend direction, slope, and estimated days until breach. Useful for capacity planning — point it at CPU, memory, or disk and set a threshold to get an early warning.
- **`correlate_metrics`** — Computes a Pearson correlation matrix across up to 10 metric series. Helps answer "are these metrics related?" — for example, does CPU spike when memory does? Highlights strong correlations (|r| > 0.7) automatically. Each source can be from a different device.
- **`detect_change_points`** — Finds moments where metric behavior shifted using the CUSUM algorithm. Instead of just looking at whether a value is high or low, it detects when the pattern changed — a sudden jump, a drop to a new baseline, or a regime shift. Sensitivity is configurable.
- **`score_alert_noise`** — Scores how noisy your alert environment is on a 0-100 scale. Combines Shannon entropy (how spread out alerts are across sources), flap detection (alerts that clear and re-fire within 30 minutes), and repeat ratio. Returns the top noisy devices and datasources with tuning recommendations.
- **`detect_seasonality`** — Checks whether a metric has a repeating pattern using autocorrelation. Tests standard intervals (1h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 7d) and reports which periods show strong periodicity. Useful for distinguishing "this spikes every day at 2pm" from "this is random."
- **`calculate_availability`** — Computes SLA-style uptime percentage from alert history. Merges overlapping alert windows and returns availability %, MTTR, incident count, longest incident duration, and a per-device breakdown. Filterable by severity threshold and time range.
- **`analyze_blast_radius`** — Scores the downstream impact if a device goes down. Walks the topology map to find dependent devices and produces an impact score. Useful for change management — check the blast radius before taking a device offline for maintenance.
- **`correlate_changes`** — Cross-references alert activity with audit/change logs to find correlations. Identifies config changes, device updates, or user actions that occurred within a configurable window before alert spikes. Each correlation gets a confidence score based on time proximity.
- **`classify_trend`** — Categorizes a metric's recent behavior into one of five patterns: stable, increasing, decreasing, cyclic, or volatile. A quick way to triage a metric without staring at a graph — run it across multiple datapoints to see what's moving.
- **`score_device_health`** — Produces a composite health score from 0-100 by computing z-scores for each datapoint's latest value against its historical window. Weights are configurable. Returns an overall status (healthy/degraded/critical) and identifies the top contributing factors dragging the score down.

2 analysis workflows:
- `capacity_forecast` — runs forecast_metric + classify_trend
- `device_health_assessment` — runs score_device_health + analyze_blast_radius + get_metric_anomalies

Shared statistical helpers module (`stats_helpers.py`) for reusable math utilities.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- Metric data API returns values as list-of-lists, not dict

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

5 AI analysis tools for server-side intelligence on monitoring data.

- **`correlate_alerts`** — Groups related alerts together by device, datasource, and time proximity. Instead of looking at alerts one by one, it clusters them to show which alerts are part of the same incident. Helps cut through a noisy alert storm to see "these 15 alerts are actually 3 distinct issues."
- **`get_alert_statistics`** — Aggregates alert counts across severity, device, datasource, and time buckets. Returns a statistical summary over a configurable time window — think of it as a quick dashboard view of alert volume and distribution without needing to open the portal.
- **`get_metric_anomalies`** — Detects datapoints that are deviating significantly from their historical mean using z-score analysis. Point it at a device and it flags which metrics are behaving abnormally right now. Useful for triage — instead of checking every graph, let it tell you what looks off.
- **`save_baseline`** — Snapshots a metric's historical behavior — mean, min, max, and standard deviation per datapoint — and stores it in the session. Use this to capture what "normal" looks like before a maintenance window, deployment, or any planned change.
- **`compare_to_baseline`** — Compares current metric values against a previously saved baseline. Reports deviation percentage and status (normal, elevated, critical) for each datapoint. The companion to `save_baseline` — run it after a change to see if anything drifted from where it was.

3 workflow prompts:
- `top_talkers` — Identify the noisiest devices and datasources generating the most alerts
- `rca_workflow` — Guided root cause analysis combining alert correlation, topology, and change history
- `capacity_forecast` — Forecast capacity trends and predict days-until-threshold-breach

Enhanced `alert_correlation` prompt with `device_id`/`group_id` scoping and correlation tool integration.

MCP orchestration guide resource (`lm://guide/mcp-orchestration`) documenting multi-MCP-server patterns.

Session persistence via `LM_SESSION_PERSIST_PATH` — session variables survive restarts.

HTTP analysis API: `POST /api/v1/analyze`, `GET /api/v1/analysis/{id}`, `POST /api/v1/webhooks/alert` for scheduled and webhook-triggered analysis workflows.
