<!-- mcp-name: io.github.ryanmat/logicmonitor -->

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for LogicMonitor REST API v3 integration. Enables AI assistants to interact with LogicMonitor monitoring data through 298 structured tools, 15 workflow prompts, and 26 resources. Optional integrations: IBM watsonx.ai for Granite TTM forecasting and NL summaries, Terraform IaC for any provider, and HuggingFace local Granite model fallback.

Works with any MCP-compatible client: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Cline, and more.

## Quick Start

**1. Get your LogicMonitor Bearer Token:**
- Log into your LogicMonitor portal
- Go to **Settings** → **Users and Roles** → **API Tokens**
- Create a new API-only user or add a token to an existing user
- Copy the Bearer token

**2. Configure your MCP client:**

For **Claude Code** (CLI):
```bash
claude mcp add logicmonitor \
  -e LM_PORTAL=yourcompany.logicmonitor.com \
  -e LM_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token \
  -- uvx --from lm-mcp lm-mcp-server
```

With **IBM watsonx.ai integration** (optional -- adds Granite TTM forecasting and NL summaries):
```bash
claude mcp add logicmonitor \
  -e LM_PORTAL=yourcompany.logicmonitor.com \
  -e LM_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token \
  -e WATSONX_API_KEY=your-ibm-cloud-api-key \
  -e WATSONX_URL=https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com \
  -e WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your-watsonx-project-id \
  -- uvx --from "lm-mcp[ibm]" lm-mcp-server
```

With **Terraform IaC** (optional -- adds terraform plan/apply/generate tools):
```bash
claude mcp add logicmonitor \
  -e LM_PORTAL=yourcompany.logicmonitor.com \
  -e LM_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token \
  -e TF_WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/terraform/workspaces \
  -- uvx --from lm-mcp lm-mcp-server
```

With **HuggingFace local models** (optional -- local Granite TTM + NL summaries, no cloud API needed):
```bash
claude mcp add logicmonitor \
  -e LM_PORTAL=yourcompany.logicmonitor.com \
  -e LM_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token \
  -- uvx --from "lm-mcp[huggingface]" lm-mcp-server
```

For **Claude Desktop**, add to your config file (see [MCP Client Configuration](#mcp-client-configuration) below).

**3. Verify it's working:**
```
claude mcp list
```

You should see: `logicmonitor: uvx --from lm-mcp lm-mcp-server - ✓ Connected`

**4. Test with a prompt:**
```
"Show me all critical alerts in LogicMonitor"
```

## What's New in v4.0.0

**Major.** Every tool now wraps an endpoint proven to exist, validated against a live
portal. Six tools that called nonexistent API paths since introduction are removed
(`get_cloud_cost_accounts`, `get_cost_summary`, `get_resource_cost`,
`get_remediation_status`, `get_remediation_history`, `get_batchjob_history`); the cost
recommendation tools move onto the working `/cost-optimization` API; the Service Insight
tools query real Service Insight objects (deviceType 6 devices and BizService groups)
instead of the legacy v1 websites API. The Automated Diagnostics & Remediation surface
arrives in full: `get_diagnostic_remediation_assignments` and
`get_diagnostic_remediation_results` (structured execution records with script output,
replacing audit-log scraping), `execute_diagnostic`, full CRUD plus import/export for
diagnostic and remediation sources, and the new action chain / action rule namespace
(11 tools including the `set_action_rule_status` toggle). `update_logicmodule` gains the
two new source types and its apply mode actually applies now (it previously tripped its
own sub-tools' confirm guards). `run_report` executions are pollable via
`get_report_execution`, `get_alert_details` can fetch the full message body, and NextGen
reports are visible to the report list tools.

Full release history, including v3.9.x and earlier, is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The v3.8.0 networking intelligence tools have a dedicated reference: [documentation/networking-intelligence.md](documentation/networking-intelligence.md).

## Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Alert Management**: Query, acknowledge, bulk acknowledge, add notes, view rules
- **Device Management**: Full CRUD - list, create, update, delete devices and groups
- **Metrics & Data**: Query datasources, instances, metric data, and graphs. Instance CRUD for manual datasource instances.
- **Dashboard Management**: Full CRUD for dashboards, widgets, and groups
- **SDT Management**: Create, list, bulk create/delete Scheduled Downtime

### AI Analysis Tools

Server-side intelligence that transforms raw monitoring data into actionable insights:

- **Alert Correlation**: Automatically clusters related alerts by device, datasource, and temporal proximity — replaces dozens of manual API calls with a single aggregated view
- **Alert Statistics**: Aggregated alert counts by severity, top-10 devices and datasources, time-bucketed distributions for trend analysis
- **Metric Anomaly Detection**: Multi-method anomaly detection (z-score, IQR, MAD) with auto-selection based on data distribution
- **Metric Baselines**: Save baseline snapshots of metric behavior, then compare current performance against the baseline to detect drift
- **Scheduled Analysis**: HTTP API endpoints for triggering analysis workflows (alert correlation, RCA, top talkers, health checks) from external schedulers and webhooks

### ML/Statistical Analysis Tools

Pure-Python statistical methods for capacity planning, trend analysis, and operational scoring:

- **Metric Forecasting**: Linear regression, Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing, and IBM Granite TTM (via watsonx.ai, optional) with auto-selection, confidence intervals, and threshold breach prediction
- **Metric Correlation**: Pearson correlation matrix across multiple metric series with strong-correlation highlighting
- **Error Budget Tracking**: SLO-based error budget calculation with burn rate, projected exhaustion, and status classification
- **Change Point Detection**: CUSUM algorithm for identifying regime shifts and mean-level changes
- **Alert Noise Scoring**: Shannon entropy and flap detection to quantify alert noise (0-100) with tuning recommendations
- **Seasonality Detection**: Autocorrelation-based periodicity detection at standard intervals with peak-hour identification
- **Availability Calculation**: SLA-style uptime percentage from alert history with MTTR, incident counts, and per-device breakdown
- **Blast Radius Analysis**: Topology-based downstream impact scoring for device failure scenarios
- **Change Correlation**: Cross-references alert spikes with audit/change logs to identify change-induced incidents
- **Trend Classification**: Categorizes metrics as stable, increasing, decreasing, cyclic, or volatile
- **Device Health Scoring**: Multi-metric composite health score (0-100) using z-score analysis with configurable weights

### Composite Workflow Tools

Multi-step analysis tools that combine several sub-tools into a single call. Each supports `detail_level` ("summary" or "full"), optional `summarize=true` for plain-English NL summaries via IBM Granite (requires watsonx.ai), and handles sub-tool failures gracefully with partial results.

- **Triage**: Correlates active alerts, scores noise, analyzes blast radius, and cross-references recent changes
- **Health Check**: Device health score, monitoring coverage, anomaly detection, active alerts, and 30-day availability
- **Capacity Plan**: Per-datasource forecasting, trend classification, seasonality detection, and change point analysis
- **Portal Overview**: Alert statistics, collector health, active SDTs, alert clusters, noise assessment, and down devices
- **Diagnose**: Alert details, device context, correlation, blast radius, health scoring, and root cause analysis
- **Update LogicModule (Safe Partial Updates)**: `update_logicmodule(type, id, changes, mode)` exports the current full definition, deep-merges your `changes`, validates required fields, and returns a dry-run diff (default) or applies the merge. Prevents the full-replace blanking that wiped production Groovy scripts in two prior incidents. Supports configsource, datasource, eventsource, logsource, propertysource, topologysource.
- **Search Tools**: Keyword search across all tools by name and description with category filtering

### APM Trace Tools

Service discovery and RED metrics for LogicMonitor APM (Application Performance Monitoring):

- **Service Discovery**: List all traced services, inspect individual service details and properties
- **Operation Listing**: Discover endpoints/routes monitored within each service
- **RED Metrics**: Duration, error count, and operation count at both service and per-operation level
- **Alert Integration**: View active alerts for any traced service
- **Property Inspection**: OTel attributes, namespace info, and auto-discovered metadata

### Ansible Automation Platform Integration

18 tools for observability-driven remediation via Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). Connects LogicMonitor alerts to automated remediation playbooks.

- **Job Templates**: List, inspect, and launch job templates with extra variables and host limits
- **Job Execution**: Launch jobs, check status, view output, cancel or relaunch runs
- **Workflows**: Launch workflow templates, monitor multi-step automation sequences
- **Inventories & Hosts**: List inventories, inspect hosts for targeted remediation
- **Projects & Credentials**: Browse available projects and credentials (secrets never exposed)
- **Write Protection**: launch_job, launch_workflow, cancel_job, relaunch_job require `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true`
- **Jinja2 Safety**: All extra_vars inputs are validated to prevent template injection

AAP tools are optional — they only appear when `AWX_URL` and `AWX_TOKEN` are configured. See [Example Playbooks](examples/playbooks/) for remediation templates.

### IBM watsonx.ai Integration

Optional AI-powered enhancements using IBM Granite foundation models via watsonx.ai. Requires an IBM Cloud account with a watsonx.ai project (Lite/free tier supported).

- **Granite TTM Forecasting**: ML-powered time series forecasting using IBM Granite Tiny Time Mixer (TTM). Use `method="ttm"` on `forecast_metric` for 96-step predictions that detect seasonality and non-linear patterns. Requires 512+ data points. Gracefully falls back to statistical methods when data is insufficient.
- **Granite NL Summaries**: Plain-English shift-handoff summaries on composite workflow tools (`triage`, `diagnose`, `health_check`, `capacity_plan`, `portal_overview`). Pass `summarize=true` to append an IBM Granite-generated analysis summary to the structured output.
- **watsonx_summarize**: Standalone tool that takes any JSON data and generates a concise NL summary via Granite 4.0. Useful for summarizing output from any MCP tool.

watsonx tools are optional — they only appear when `WATSONX_API_KEY` and `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID` are configured. Install with `lm-mcp[ibm]` to include the IBM SDK dependencies.

**Setup:**
1. Create a free IBM Cloud account at [cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com)
2. Provision **watsonx.ai Runtime** (Lite plan, free) from the IBM Cloud catalog
3. Create a watsonx.ai project and associate the Runtime instance
4. Generate an IBM Cloud API key at [cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys)
5. Configure the MCP server with `WATSONX_API_KEY`, `WATSONX_URL`, and `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID`

### Terraform Integration

11 tools for Infrastructure as Code workflows with any Terraform provider. AI agents can author HCL, use pre-made scripts, or reverse-engineer existing LM resources.

- **terraform_init**: Initialize workspace and download providers
- **terraform_validate**: Syntax-check HCL configuration
- **terraform_plan**: Preview changes with structured JSON output
- **terraform_apply**: Apply changes (triple-gated: write perms + config flag + confirm param)
- **terraform_destroy**: Destroy infrastructure (same triple gate)
- **terraform_import**: Import existing resources into Terraform state
- **terraform_state_list / terraform_state_show**: Inspect current state
- **terraform_output**: View Terraform outputs
- **terraform_write_config**: Write HCL files to workspace directories
- **terraform_generate**: Export existing LM portal resources as HCL using the `logicmonitor/logicmonitor` provider

Terraform tools are optional -- they only appear when `TF_WORKSPACE_DIR` is configured. Requires the `terraform` CLI installed separately.

**Three entry points:**
1. **Agent-authored**: AI generates HCL from natural language, writes to workspace, plans, applies
2. **Pre-made scripts**: Point `TF_WORKSPACE_DIR` at existing `.tf` files, agent operates on them
3. **Reverse-engineer**: `terraform_generate` exports LM resources as HCL, then import into state

### HuggingFace Local Fallback

When watsonx.ai API credentials are not configured, TTM forecasting and NL summaries automatically fall back to local Granite models via HuggingFace transformers. Install with `lm-mcp[huggingface]`.

**Priority chain:** watsonx.ai API (remote) > HuggingFace local > statistical/linear

- **TTM Model**: `ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2` (512 context, 96 forecast)
- **LLM Model**: `ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct` (2B params, runs on CPU)
- Models lazy-load on first inference call (initial download: ~500MB TTM, ~4GB LLM)
- Same interface as WatsonxClient -- all existing watsonx tools work with either backend

### LogicModules
- **DataSources**: Query and export datasource definitions
- **ConfigSources**: Query definitions, retrieve device config data from the Config Archive, view diffs, trigger on-demand collection, and audit change history
- **EventSources**: Query and export event detection modules
- **PropertySources**: Query, create, and export property collection modules
- **TopologySources**: Query and export topology mapping modules
- **LogSources**: Query and export log collection modules
- **Import Support**: Import LogicModules from JSON definitions

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Cost Optimization**: Cost recommendations, recommendation categories, idle resources (LM Envision)
- **Network Topology**: Device neighbors, interfaces, flows, connections
- **Batch Jobs**: View and manage batch job execution history
- **Log/Metric Ingestion**: Push logs and metrics via LMv1 authentication

### MCP Protocol Features
- **Resources**: 26 schema/enum/filter/guide resources for API reference
- **Prompts**: 15 workflow templates (incident triage, RCA, capacity forecasting, remediation execution, etc.)
- **Completions**: Auto-complete for tool arguments

### Claude Code Skills

- Simpler setup, works for most operations
- Set `LM_BEARER_TOKEN`

**LMv1 HMAC (Required for Ingestion):**
- Required for `ingest_logs` and `push_metrics` tools
- Set both `LM_ACCESS_ID` and `LM_ACCESS_KEY`
- Can be used alongside Bearer token

### Getting API Credentials

**Bearer Token:**
1. Log into your LogicMonitor portal
2. Go to **Settings** → **Users and Roles** → **API Tokens**
3. Create a new API-only user or add a token to an existing user
4. Copy the Bearer token

**LMv1 Credentials:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Users and Roles** → **Users**
2. Select a user → **API Tokens** tab
3. Create or view the Access ID and Access Key

## MCP Client Configuration

The [Quick Start](#quick-start) covers Claude Code. Every JSON-based client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex) runs the same server with the same block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logicmonitor": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "lm-mcp", "lm-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "LM_PORTAL": "yourcompany.logicmonitor.com",
        "LM_BEARER_TOKEN": "your-bearer-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS`, `LM_ACCESS_ID`/`LM_ACCESS_KEY` (ingestion), or the watsonx/Terraform variables to `env` as needed. Per-client config file locations and exact steps (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Codex, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI) are in **[documentation/client-setup.md](documentation/client-setup.md)**.

### Cursor's 40-tool cap

Cursor only loads the first 40 MCP tools, so the remaining ~240 are invisible to the agent. Use `LM_MCP_CATEGORIES` to fit a curated subset under the cap. The `workflow` category alone (`triage`, `diagnose`, `health_check`, `portal_overview`, `capacity_plan`, plus the scoring/correlation tools and `update_logicmodule`) is roughly 23 tools and covers the 80% case:

```json
"env": {
  "LM_PORTAL": "yourcompany.logicmonitor.com",
  "LM_BEARER_TOKEN": "your-bearer-token",
  "LM_MCP_CATEGORIES": "workflow"
}
```

`LM_MCP_CATEGORIES` composes with `LM_ENABLED_TOOLS` by intersection (it only narrows, never expands); unset, the server returns all 298 tools. See [documentation/client-setup.md](documentation/client-setup.md) for a surgical `LM_ENABLED_TOOLS` example.

## Available Tools

298 tools cover the full LogicMonitor surface plus the optional Ansible Automation Platform, Terraform, and IBM watsonx.ai integrations. The complete per-tool reference (every tool, its parameters, and its read/write classification) is in **[documentation/tools.md](documentation/tools.md)**, generated from the tool registry so it never drifts.

Discover tools at runtime without leaving your client:

- `search_tools`: keyword search across every tool by name and description
- the `lm://guide/tool-categories` resource: all 298 tools grouped by domain

Tools are organized into these categories: Alerts, Alert Rules, Devices, Metrics, APM Traces, Dashboards, SDT, Collectors, Websites, Escalations, Device Properties, Reports, DataSources, LogicModules (Config/Event/Property/Topology/Log), Cost Optimization, Actions (Chains & Rules), Ingestion, Network & Topology, Batch Jobs, Ops & Audit, Users & Access, Services, Netscans, OIDs, Session, Correlation & Analysis, Baselines, ML/Statistical Analysis, Ansible Automation Platform, Remediation, Composite Workflows, and Error Budget.

## Example Usage

Once configured, ask your assistant in natural language. A representative sample (the server understands far more across all 298 tools):

- "List the first 5 devices in LogicMonitor" (quick connectivity check)
- "Show me all critical alerts from the last hour"
- "Acknowledge alert LMA12345 with note 'Investigating disk issue'"
- "What datasources are applied to device 123, and get CPU metrics for the last hour"
- "Create a dashboard called 'API Health' and add a graph widget"
- "Create a 2-hour maintenance window (SDT) for device 123"
- "Triage all critical alerts from the last 4 hours"
- "Run a health check on device 123, then give me a portal overview for shift handoff"
- "Forecast when memory on device 123 will hit 90%"
- "What's the blast radius if device 789 goes down?"
- "What diagnostics ran on device 123 today, and what did the scripts output?"

For power users, the server accepts LogicMonitor filter syntax directly, for example "Get devices where filter is 'displayName~prod,hostStatus:alive'".

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect" in Claude Code

If `claude mcp list` shows `✗ Failed to connect`, the server is missing environment variables. The `-e` flags must be included when adding the server:

```bash
# Remove the broken config
claude mcp remove logicmonitor

# Re-add with environment variables
claude mcp add logicmonitor \
  -e LM_PORTAL=yourcompany.logicmonitor.com \
  -e LM_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token \
  -- uvx --from lm-mcp lm-mcp-server
```

> **Note:** Setting environment variables in your shell or `.env` file won't work—Claude Code spawns the MCP server as a subprocess with its own environment.

### "Write operations are disabled"

Write operations (acknowledge, create SDT, etc.) are disabled by default. Set `LM_ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true` in your environment.

### "spawn uvx ENOENT" in Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop can't find `uvx`. Use the full path:

```json
{
  "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx",
  "args": ["--from", "lm-mcp", "lm-mcp-server"]
}
```

Find your uvx path with: `which uvx`

### Ingestion API Errors

The `ingest_logs` and `push_metrics` tools require LMv1 authentication. Bearer tokens don't work with ingestion APIs. Add `LM_ACCESS_ID` and `LM_ACCESS_KEY` to your configuration.

### Rate Limit Errors

The server automatically retries rate-limited requests with exponential backoff. If you're consistently hitting limits, reduce request frequency or contact LogicMonitor support.

### Authentication Errors

Verify your bearer token is correct and has appropriate permissions. API tokens can be managed in LogicMonitor under **Settings** → **Users and Roles** → **API Tokens**.
